# DH2323_Ocean_simulation
This repository is my project in the DH2323 Computer graphics and interaction where I built a real-time ocean simulation using Unity and ShaderLab.

Below is one of the final images which became better than I expected:

### Gerstner waves: 

Gerstner waves are a common way to simulate ocean motion where the discplacement occurs in a circular motion:

in short instead of purely displacing vertices up and down the points move horizontally as well and a point P can be described as: 

P (x,y,t) = ( x+ W1(),y+ W2(), W3(),)

where 
W1() =  QiAiDi.x cos(wiDi(x,y) +ti)
W2() =  QiAiDi.y cos(wiDi(x,y) +ti)
W3() =  Aisin(wiDi(x,y) +ti)

### Fractal Brownian Motion: 

Fractal Brownian Motion is the process of creating values that tend to similar to previous values but still appear random to us. It is essential created through multiple layers of Perlin noise and is a common application within procedural generation. In short it is used to create random values without being completely random. I higly recommend to read this chapter from The Book of Shaders: https://thebookofshaders.com/13/ as it explains the concept quite well.



## Theoretical 
I will base the ocean simulations on a combination of the Sum of sines method, Gerstner Waves and Fractal Brownian Motion. This method provides in-theory friendly realtime performance.

Gerstner waves act as an approximate solution to the fluid dynamic equation where the model describes the ocean surface in terms of individual points where the displacement at time.

The ocean will be a sum of these Gerstner waves and describe the position P on the surface as : 

P (x,y,t) = ( x+ W1(),y+ W2(), W3(),)

Where : 

W1() =  QiAiDi.x cos(wiDi(x,y) +ti)
W2() =  QiAiDi.y cos(wiDi(x,y) +ti)
W3() =  Aisin(wiDi(x,y) +ti)

With the help of the Gerstner function we can also calculate the normals of the ocean surface through the use of partial derivatives of the binormal B and the tangent T.

B=(1-  QiDi.x2WAS(),- QiDi.yDi.xWAS(), Di.xWAC())  
T=(-  QiDi.x2WAS(),1- QiDi.y2WAS(), Di.xWAC())  

The cross product of B and T gives us the normal N: 

N=(-  Di.xWAC(),- Di.yWAC(),1- QiWAs())  

Where : 
S() = sin(wiDiP +ti), 
C() = cos(wiDiP+ti) ,
WA = wiAi
The term Q is a parameter used to control the steepness of a wave and is usually described as 1 divided by WA [1]. The speed C of an wave can also be controlled by the wavelength [1,2]: 

C =g k  = g 2L

In which k is the magnitude of 2L .


Within this project, Fractal Brownian Motion will be used to add variations to both the waves and the normal maps. Fractal Brownian Motion (FBM) is a common model within computer graphics used for the purpose of creating values that tend to be similar to previous values with the random variations added [4,5,9]. In essence it is used to create variations that appear random to human perception while not being entirely random. 

Finally to add rendering details I will be adding basic Fresnel reflections.  Fresnel describes how much light is being refracted and how much is reflected. Often the following approximation is used: 

ReflectionCoefficient = Max(0,min(1,bias+scale 1+IN)power)

Where the bias, scale and power are parameters chosen by the artist. The vectors I and N are the incident vector (viewdirection vector) and normal vector respectively [6]. A simplified version of this approximation will be used instead as the many parameters can produce poor results if care is not taken.
